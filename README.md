## ColorBurst

This React project is a color generator application that allows users to `input color values`. The application generates a list of colors based on user inputs. Each color in the list is displayed with its hex value and weight percentage. Users can `copy the hex value` of a color to the `clipboard` by clicking on it. The project also includes features like `error handling` for color generation failures and displaying `toast messages` for user interactions.
